##### My work 

I am a researcher in the applied epidemiology and behavioural science of addiction. My work uses a systems lens, recognising that changing behavior to minimise the harms from addiction involves multiple factors at the individual, community and population level. I conduct policy-oriented research to inform improvements in the health of populations and priority groups in society that experience a disproportionate level of harm from substance use.
